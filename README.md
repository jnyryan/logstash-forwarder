# Troubleshooting

Issue
Failed to tls handshake with 127.0.0.1 x509: certificate is valid for , not localhost
Resolution
I was told on IRC that this was caused by forwarder and indexer using a mismatch of TLS/SSL versions. I downloaded Java from java.com and can confirm that using Oracle Java 1.7.0_45 completes the TLS handshake without problems. Thanks to "whack" for his time and immediate attention into this problem.
